Stash
git stash - your modified tracked files and staged changes, saves it on a stack of unfinished changes that you can reapply at any time.
git stash apply stash@{2} - If you donâ€™t specify a stash, Git assumes the most recent stash and tries to apply it
git stash pop - apply the stash and then immediately drop it from your stack.
